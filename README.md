# consbol-notebook
A living document defining and implementing consbol

This repository tracks a julia pluto notebook that contains parallel human-readable and machine-readable definitions of the consbol vocabulary, syntax and semantics.
It also provides an example mechanical reasoning system able to process constraints using this vocabulary.
The document is presented as a living document, which will undergo revisions and modifications as the consbol vocabularly matures.
